#Weather Py Trend Analysis
1. From the figure "Lattitude Vs. Temperature", one can see the temperature peaks around the equator.  Using a colormap to further help to visualize we see the concentration of red plot points centered around the equator.
2. From the figure "Lattitude Vs. Humidity", one can see the humidity percentage is also generally higher around the equator as well.  Higher humidity in general gives the impression of an area being "hotter".
3. From the figure "Lattitude Vs. Windiness", one can see that although the windiness is generally spread about evenly over the lattitudes, there is a small dip around the equator.  It would seem in addition to being hotter and more humid around the equator, it also seems to have less windiness.  This would also add to general consensus of the temperature getting hotter as one approaches the equator.
