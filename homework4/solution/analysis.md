# Trend Analysis for PyCitySchool Assignment

1. Analyzing the table in the "Scores by School Spending" table, the average amount spent per student doesn't seem to affect whether a student passes.  In fact it seems the less amount that is spent on the student the higher their overall passing percentage.  It would be good to see if the students that have less spent on them are part of charter schools as the costs are usually passed onto the student's parents versus the school.

2. Analyzing the "Scores by School Size" table, small to medium size schools seem to have a significant higher passing percentage versus the larger schools.  Additionally it seems that students who attend a charter school also seem to do signficantly better than district type schools.  It would likely be probable that the charter school sizes are heavily in the small to medium category outlined in the table.
